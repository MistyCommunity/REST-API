# REST API Sample Code

This folder contains sample code that show how to use different features of Misty's REST API and WebSocket data streams. 

To run this code, you must first use the green __Clone or download__ button to copy the files onto your desktop. This ensures you have the **Tools** directory in the appropriate folder relative to the rest of the code in the repository.

Most of the examples in this folder run from an `.html` page that you load in your web browser to send Misty commands and receive event data over your local Wi-Fi network. These samples require you to update the `.html` file with your robot's IP address before they can run. You can then launch the application by opening the `.html` page in your web browser. To view debug messages and other information from the robot and the application, open the development console in your browser window.

*Our goal is to keep these samples up-to-date with Misty's current software. If you have questions or find something that's not working, let us know by [posting in the Community Forums](https://community.mistyrobotics.com/c/support), or create an issue right here in the REST-API repository.*
